# Step 5

## Porting unit tests to C

C does not have a standard or built in test framework like `pytest`. Instead there are a host of third party options to choose from.

- [ ] Choose a C test framework (some options linked below)
  - [MinUnit](https://jera.com/techinfo/jtns/jtn002)
  - [&#0181;nit](https://nemequ.github.io/munit/)
  - [cmocka](https://cmocka.org/)

1. Explain what we have working so far and what our next step is
2. Display image of calls and tests (images/step5.png)

- [ ] Write unit tests for your C code

## Makefile...

Link to Makefile tutorial

1. test option
2. build option
3. run option

-  [ ] Makefile...

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As always, create a new branch off `main` for your changes and once you have them working, submit a PR (pull request) into `main` and set me as a reviewer.
