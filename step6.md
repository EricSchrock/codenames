WORK IN PROGRESS

1. Port state data structures to C (need different data structures?)
2. Port rendering code to C (use hard coded states for testing display)
3. Port input processing code to C
  1. Include instructions on random number generation in C
    - Tip: replacing the random functions from Python may be tricky. Maybe calculate random numbers for which lines to read in the input file instead of reading the whole file.
  2. Review Python code for other parts that will be tricky to port to C (sorting?)
