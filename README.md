# Codenames project

This repository contains instructions I created to help a college student refactor one of their [class projects](https://github.com/LKieser/codenames) and port it from Python to C. A lot of the material was inspired by [write ups](https://github.com/EricSchrock/software-engineering-intro) I had previously created for structuring a software engineering mentorship.


### Steps

1. [Setup (environment, version control, and baseline)](https://github.com/EricSchrock/codenames/blob/master/step1.md)
2. [Game loop refinement](https://github.com/EricSchrock/codenames/blob/master/step2.md)
3. [Adding tests](https://github.com/EricSchrock/codenames/blob/master/step3.md)
