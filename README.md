# Codenames

This repository contains instructions I created to help a college student refactor one of their [class projects](https://github.com/LKieser/codenames) and port it from Python to C. A lot of the material was inspired by [write ups](https://github.com/EricSchrock/software-engineering-intro) I had previously created for structuring a software engineering mentorship.


### Steps

1. [Setup (environment, version control, and baseline)](https://github.com/EricSchrock/codenames/blob/master/step1.md)
2. [Game loop refinement](https://github.com/EricSchrock/codenames/blob/master/step2.md)
3. [Adding tests](https://github.com/EricSchrock/codenames/blob/master/step3.md)
4. [Calling C code from Python](https://github.com/EricSchrock/codenames/blob/master/step4.md)
5. Port unit tests to C (todo)
6. Full port to C (todo)
7. Documentation with Markdown and flow charts (todo)
8. Auto-formatting, static analysis, and dynamic analysis (todo)
9. Demos and user feedback (todo)
10. Port from TUI to GUI (todo)
11. Add project to professional portfolio (todo)
